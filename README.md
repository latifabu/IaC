# IAC with Ansible


### Let's create Vagrantfile to create Three VMs for Ansible architecture
#### Ansible controller and Ansible agents

- We need a different infrastructure. So we use infrastructure as code, can launch to many machines not just one conf like provision.db
- Any file that has an extension of YAML/YML â€“ YET ANOTHER MARKUP LANGUAGE 
- YAML/YML can be used on multiple platforms : can be used on aws, etc
- YAML/TML is useful because it is reusable thus saving us time
What is Ansible?
- An automation code: a configuration management tool, we can config everything regardless of where the machine is, on prem, hybrid, public or multi-cloud
- It can talk to all machines if the description is right, can connect to 100s of servers with one file and do different tasks.
- Aws has special services, management, can go serverless, like automated driving. Like a car without a driver a serverless services can run by itself. 
- In serverless, you put the instructions in, and it does everything on its own 

Setting up Ansible Controller

- get upgrade
- get update
- install dependencies
- install ansible
- tree
- set up agent nodes
- default folder strcutures/ etc/ ansible
- hosts file - agent node called web ip of the web.
